                <h3>RHINOS</h3>
                <p>Rhinos are large, thick-skinned herbivores known for their impressive horns and prehistoric appearance. There are five species of rhino, with the white and black rhinos native to Africa, and the Indian, Javan, and Sumatran rhinos found in Asia.</p>
                <p>Rhinos spend much of their day grazing on grasses or browsing leaves and branches. Despite their size and strength, rhinos are generally peaceful but can charge if threatened. Their horns are made of keratin, the same substance as human fingernails.</p>
                <p>Sadly, rhinos are critically endangered due to poaching and habitat loss. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect these magnificent animals for future generations.</p>
                <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                <p>You will find the rhinos at pen R8, close to the central lake in the zoo.</p>
