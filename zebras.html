                <h3>ZEBRAS</h3>
                <p>Zebras are African equines best known for their distinctive black-and-white striped coats. Each zebra's stripe pattern is unique, and these stripes help to camouflage them in the wild, confuse predators, and regulate their body temperature.</p>
                <p>There are three main species of zebra: the plains zebra, the mountain zebra, and the Gr√©vy's zebra. Zebras are social animals that live in groups called harems or herds. They are herbivores, grazing mostly on grasses, but will also eat leaves and stems.</p>
                <p>Zebras are fast runners and rely on their speed and agility to escape predators such as lions and hyenas. They communicate with each other through vocalizations, facial expressions, and body movements.</p>
                <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                <p>You will find the zebras at pen Z10, near the main entrance of the zoo.</p>
