                <h3>TIGERS</h3>
                <p>Tigers are the largest members of the cat family and are renowned for their power and striking orange-and-black striped coats. Each tiger's stripe pattern is unique, providing camouflage in their natural habitats.</p>
                <p>Native to Asia, tigers are solitary hunters and can be found in a variety of environments, including forests, grasslands, and swamps. They are carnivores, preying on deer, wild boar, and other large mammals.</p>
                <p>Tigers are excellent swimmers and often cool off in pools or streams. Sadly, tigers are endangered due to habitat loss and poaching, making conservation efforts critical for their survival.</p>
                <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                <p>You will find the tigers at pen T5, near the eastern side of the zoo.</p>
